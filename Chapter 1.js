// CODE WITH HARRY JS CH#1 PRACTICE SET
/*
1. Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
2. Use the "typeof" operator to find the datatype of the string in question 1.
3. Create a const object. Can you change it to hold a number later?
4. Try to add a key to the const object in question 3. Were you able to do it?
5. Write a program to create a dictionary of 5 words.
*/

// Question 1
let myName = "Huzaifa";
let myAge  = 20;
console.log(myName + myAge);   // This joins the two variables as a string and outputs "Huzaifa20".

// Question 2
let myString = myName + myAge;
console.log(typeof myString);   // This is output "string".

// Question 3
const myObject = {
  name : "Huzaifa",
  age : 20,
  weight : 57.6
}
myObject = 1234;
console.log(myObject); // This is throw a error because myObject can not be assigned a new value. It is declared as a const and is unchangable.

// Question 4
myObject.lastname = "Siddique"; //Yes I was able to add a new key/value pair because the object itself is mutable which means that its contents can be changed.

// Question 5
let myDict = {
  "prominent" : "famous",
  "attain" : "to get",
  "absence" : "lack of something or someone",
  "fullstop" : "symbol used to end a sentence",
  "javascript" : "a programming language used mainly for web development."
